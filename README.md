## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Summary

This repo presents a **data-driven investigation** into the reality behind the narrative that manufacturing jobs are returning to the U.S. as high-wage opportunities for blue-collar workers. While reshoring is occurring, the nature of these jobs is fundamentally different due to **automation, robotics, and global labor dynamics**. Each graph in this analysis is based on credible academic and industry sources, coded using `R` and `ggplot2`, and styled with a businesslike, earth-toned aesthetic.

## üîπ Dataset & Code Snapshots

### 1. Job Displacement Due to Automation

```r
job_displacement <- data.frame(
  robots_per_1000 = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  employment_drop = c(0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.6, -0.8)
)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(job_displacement, aes(x = robots_per_1000, y = employment_drop)) +
  geom_line(color = "#333333", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "#8B0000", size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Impact of Automation on Employment",
       subtitle = "Each robot per 1,000 workers reduces employment by ~0.2%",

### 4. Interest in Manufacturing Roles

```r
manufacturing_interest_data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2000, 2010, 2020, 2025),
  interest_percent = c(45, 37, 29, 25)

       y = "Positive Sentiment Index (%)",
       caption = "Sources: TIME, Weibo, Global Times, modeled via tone analysis") +
  theme_minimal()

## ‚ùì Why This Matters

- üîπ **Policy Blind Spots**: Political messaging may overpromise blue-collar job revival that current trends don't support.
- üîπ **Education Gaps**: A high-school diploma alone is no longer sufficient to access new factory roles.
- üîπ **Labor Planning**: Workforce development programs must adjust to reality, not sentiment.
- üîπ **National Security**: A misreading of the labor implications of reshoring could weaken long-term industrial policy.

## üìÑ Conclusion

Despite political narratives, the **revival of U.S. manufacturing is increasingly driven by automation**, not a return to traditional factory work. The **jobs that do return are fewer, more specialized, and inaccessible to large portions of the current workforce**. Policymakers and business leaders must adopt a realistic, data-informed view to ensure effective investment in education, skills training, and economic transition strategies.
